# Google-Play-Store-apps-and-reviews
The notebook demonstrates a small data camp project.

Dataset consists of two files:

1. apps.csv: contains all the details of the applications on Google Play. There are 13 features that describe a given app.
2. user_reviews.csv: contains 100 reviews for each app, most helpful first. The text in each review has been pre-processed and attributed with three new features: Sentiment (Positive, Negative or Neutral), Sentiment Polarity and Sentiment Subjectivity.

Tasks included:

1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploring app Categories
3. Distribution of App Categories
4. Size and price of an app
5. Relation between app category and app price
6. Filter out "junk" apps
7. Popularity of paid apps vs free apps
